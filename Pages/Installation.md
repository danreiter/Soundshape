# Soundshape Installation Manual

## To run Soundshape on Windows (Only tested on Windows 10):

Extract Soundshape.zip to C:/Program Files/Common Files/VST3.
Create that folder if it does not exist. Once extracted, Soundshape.exe
can be relocated anywhere desired. We recommend having a folder for
presets in the same folder as Soundshape.exe. Run Soundshape.exe to start
making sounds. Alternatively, open your favorite digital audio workstation,
have it re-scan for plug-ins, and run Soundshape from there. Click
